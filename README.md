# Datacenter-At-Home
A homemade, full featured datacenter. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Over a two year window, I designed and assembled a home datacenter for the purposes of educating myself in the fields of Data Architechture & Engineering, as well as IT and Network Administration.

The datacenter was designed to replace all 3rd party cloud providers by supporting all my current and future data needs in a cost-effective, safe and highly personalized manner. The secondary function for the datacenter is to serve as my personal development playground, where I can design, test and deploy applications in a 100% private and secure facility

Some of the workloads include: 

1. Training Machine Learning neural networks using large training datasets (Tensorflow)
2. Executing complex workloads using Aritficial Intelligence such as text, image and video generation
3. Designing plugins and applications for popular AI platforms, such as ChatGPT. (See ShockGPT)
4. Automated acquisition, transcoding and streaming of media
5. Geolocation and IOT sensor tracking

The Datacenter is a cluster of 8 specialised servers which all work together to undertake extreme workloads. These servers are: 

1. A high performance virtualized router
2. A fast network storage server
3. A recursive DNS server
4. A high performance compute server for Virtual Machines
5. A Remote Management server (IPMI) 
6. A tier 2 redundant backup storage server
7. A tier 3 redundant backup storage server
8. A smart Power Supply (UPS)
